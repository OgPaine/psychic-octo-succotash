# Psychic Octo Succotash - Mini Games Collection

The mini-games featured here are inspired by those found in NoPixel 4.0, crafted to mirror the aesthetics and mechanics present in the server. This personal project is a homage to their design, and I intend to refine and expand upon these games as time permits.
